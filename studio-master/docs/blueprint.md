# **App Name**: FancyType

## Core Features:

- Animated rotating text: Renders an animated text that rotates between a predefined array of strings.  Each string can be animated as it enters or exits the viewport using motion
- Animation Variations: Offers several split modes ('characters', 'words', 'lines') for animation, each with distinct animation styles.
- Animation staggering: Animates elements, staggered by duration, start position (first, last, center or random)
- Parallax effect: Floating elements: wrap elements in a container and make them float in 3D space, using mouse position.
- Customization options: Configure transition type and animation properties

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) for a calm and sophisticated feel, reflecting the elegance of typography.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a neutral backdrop that enhances readability.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#D8BFD8) for interactive elements, complementing the lavender without overpowering it.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font for primary text to maintain readability and elegance. Font-weight could be slightly bolder for emphasis.
- Minimalist layout with plenty of whitespace to allow the animated text to stand out.
- Subtle, smooth transitions for the text rotation to enhance the visual appeal without being distracting.
